# Build Plan

## Approach: Localhost-first, stage by stage

Backend is built against **local SQLite, mock auth, and local file uploads**. When Sujeet (CarePal VP Engineering) provides a dedicated AWS account, each of those is a contained swap (env var or single-file replacement), not a rewrite.

Principle: **each stage ends with something clickable in the browser**, not just green tests.

Full plan reference: `.claude/plans/eager-nibbling-bear.md`

## Decisions Made
- **Framework:** Express + TypeScript + Knex + Zod
- **Local DB:** SQLite via `better-sqlite3`; production swaps to AWS-hosted SQL (Postgres or MySQL — Sujeet open to either)
- **Frontend location:** repo root (`/src/App.jsx`), not `carepal-demo/`
- **Interview scheduling:** Option A — pure form. HR checks Google Calendar in another tab, types date/interviewer into the tool, informs candidate outside the tool. No calendar API integration.
- **Document storage:** AWS S3 (NOT Google Drive). Decided on the Apr 15 call with Sujeet Yadav. Stage 7 now targets S3 directly rather than Google Drive.
- **Infrastructure topology (per Apr 15 call):** CarePal creates a **separate AWS account** dedicated to this tool, isolated from existing CarePal systems. After setup/integration, CarePal takes over credentials and ownership.
- **Hospitals / cities:** NOT master-list tables. The existing CarePal hiring-requisition Google Form (linked to the ATS) captures hospital + city + area per requisition, and our `requisitions` table already stores them as fields. No separate hospitals/cities master lists required.
- **Only CarePal-DB integration needed:** a list of city managers + BDs (for user access / headcount). Sujeet to provide via API or one-time export — pending Jesse's email with exact columns.

---

## Stage 0 — Foundation — COMPLETE
Node + Express + TypeScript scaffold in `carepal-backend/`. `/health` endpoint returns 200. ESLint + Prettier configured. `.env.local` loading via dotenv. No Docker — SQLite chosen for local DB.

**Verified:** `npm run dev` → `curl localhost:3000/health` → `{"ok":true,"uptime":...,"timestamp":"..."}`

## Stage 1 — Requisitions (vertical slice) — COMPLETE
SQLite + Knex. `requisitions` table migrated, seeded with 8 rows. API endpoints: `GET /api/requisitions` (with filters bu/city/hospital/status), `GET /api/requisitions/:id`, `POST`, `PATCH`. Zod validation enforcing `replacementFor` required for Replacement hires. Frontend (`/src/App.jsx`) wired via new `DataContext` — replaces static REQUISITIONS array. NewReqModal submits via POST. Loading/error states added.

**Verified:** POST/PATCH tested via curl; rejected payloads return 400 with Zod issues; both servers run in parallel (backend:3000, frontend:5173); 10 rows after E2E test.

**Files added:**
- Backend: `knexfile.js`, `migrations/20260414_001_create_requisitions.js`, `seeds/01_requisitions.js`, `src/db/index.ts`, `src/models/requisition.ts`, `src/schemas/requisition.ts`, `src/routes/requisitions.ts`
- Frontend: `src/api.js`, `src/DataContext.jsx`

**Data location:** `carepal-backend/data/carepal.sqlite` (gitignored)

## Stage 2 — Mock auth + RBAC — COMPLETE
`users` table migrated, seeded with 18 users (1 admin, 10 approvers, 7 TA). Mock auth middleware reads `x-user-email` header, loads user from DB, attaches to `req.user`. RBAC middleware (`requireRole`) — admins bypass all checks. Applied to requisition endpoints: POST + PATCH require `approver`. `/api/me` and `/api/users` endpoints expose the current user + list. Frontend sends `x-user-email` with every request (from localStorage, default = Akhlaque/TA). Dev-mode user switcher in the Header — change role on the fly to test RBAC. "New Requisition" button hidden for TA. "Approve Requisition" button added to detail slide-out for approvers on Pending status.

**Verified:**
- No header → 401
- Unknown email → 401
- TA → POST 403 ("Role 'ta' cannot perform this action")
- TA → PATCH approve 403
- Approver → POST/PATCH 200
- Admin → all actions 200 (role bypass)
- `raisedBy` now comes from authenticated user, not client payload

**Files added:**
- Backend: `migrations/20260415_002_create_users.js`, `seeds/02_users.js`, `src/models/user.ts`, `src/middleware/auth.ts`, `src/middleware/rbac.ts`, `src/routes/me.ts`
- Frontend: updates to `src/api.js` (adds `x-user-email` header + `me()`/`listUsers()`), `src/DataContext.jsx` (loads me + users + switchUser), `src/App.jsx` (Header user switcher, role-gated New/Approve buttons)

## Stage 3 — Candidates — COMPLETE
`candidates` table migrated (FK to requisitions, with r1/r2 interview fields as a transitional measure until Stage 4 moves them to their own table). Seeded with all 9 existing candidates. API: `GET /api/candidates` (filters: bu/reqId/stage/city), `GET /:id`, `POST`, `PATCH`. Zod validation on both POST and PATCH. Foreign-key check on POST (reject if `reqId` doesn't exist → 400). Frontend DataContext now loads candidates in parallel with requisitions/users/me; 4 components (Dashboard, Requisitions, Pipeline, Interviews) pull from context instead of the static array.

**Also in this stage:** Vite proxy added (`/api/*` → backend on `:4000`), so the frontend makes same-origin relative calls; CORS no longer needed in dev; behaviour matches production.

**Verified:**
- `GET /api/candidates` returns 9 seeded + any created via API
- `POST` with unknown `reqId` → 400 "Requisition REQ-XXX not found"
- `POST` with invalid payload → 400 with Zod issues
- Frontend loads Kanban + Table views with data from backend
- Dashboard funnel counts match DB reality
- Vite proxy verified: `curl localhost:5173/api/candidates` returns candidates via the proxy

**Files added:**
- Backend: `migrations/20260415_003_create_candidates.js`, `seeds/03_candidates.js`, `src/models/candidate.ts`, `src/schemas/candidate.ts`, `src/routes/candidates.ts`
- Frontend: updates to `src/api.js` (candidate methods, relative paths), `src/DataContext.jsx` (loads + exposes candidates), `src/App.jsx` (4 components destructure `candidates` from context)
- Config: `vite.config.js` (proxy block)

## Stage 4 — Interviews + pipeline transitions — COMPLETE
`interviews` table migrated (FK to candidates, unique per candidate+round), seeded from existing r1/r2 data. Pure `transitionStage(current, event)` state machine in `src/logic/pipeline.ts` with **23 unit tests** covering SCHEDULE_R1, RECORD_R1_RESULT, SCHEDULE_R2, RECORD_R2_RESULT, MAKE_OFFER, RECORD_JOIN (valid + invalid paths). Uses Node's built-in test runner (`node --test`). Interview API: `GET /api/interviews`, `GET /:id`, `POST` (schedule/upsert), `PATCH` (record result). Both POST and PATCH drive candidate stage transitions atomically. Hardcoded interviewers list at `GET /api/interviewers`.

**Scheduling approach: Option A — pure form (as decided).** Tool records scheduled interviews and drives pipeline stage transitions. No Google Calendar API, no .ics, no candidate invites from the tool.

Frontend: Schedule tab in CandidateModal is now fully wired — controlled form state, validation, submit via `DataContext.scheduleInterview()`, auto-navigates to Interviews tab after save. Interviews tab shows Select/Reject buttons on each scheduled round with no result yet; clicking them calls `PATCH /api/interviews/:id` and the candidate's stage updates live in the UI. Round-specific interviewer filter (R1 shows city leads, R2 shows regional heads).

**Verified end-to-end via Vite proxy:**
- C-006 (Sourced) → schedule R1 → stage becomes `R1 Scheduled`
- Record Select → stage becomes `R1 Complete`
- Schedule R2 from `R1 Complete` → stage becomes `R2 Scheduled`
- Attempting to schedule R2 from `Sourced` → 400 with `"Cannot schedule R2 from stage 'Sourced'"`
- 23/23 unit tests pass on every run

**Files added:**
- Backend: `migrations/20260415_004_create_interviews.js`, `seeds/04_interviews.js`, `src/models/interview.ts`, `src/schemas/interview.ts`, `src/routes/interviews.ts`, `src/routes/interviewers.ts`, `src/logic/pipeline.ts`, `src/logic/pipeline.test.ts`
- `npm test` script using Node's built-in test runner via tsx
- Frontend: updates to `src/api.js`, `src/DataContext.jsx`, `src/App.jsx` (CandidateModal fully rewritten for controlled form + result recording)

## Stage 5 — Headcount (auto-calculated) — PENDING
Move candidate to "Joined", active +1 and deficit −1. Deficit = Target − Active (NOT subtracting Offered).

## Stage 6 — Spreadsheet import — PENDING
Upload Excel → preview (dry-run) → commit. Candidates appear in pipeline.

## Stage 7 — Document metadata layer — PENDING
Upload to `./uploads/{candidateId}/` locally; metadata in `documents` table. Swap to **AWS S3** (not Google Drive) when CarePal provides the S3 bucket + AWS credentials. `documents` table will store `s3_key` (not `drive_file_id`). Folder/key structure not yet agreed with Sujeet — follow up via email.

## Stage 8 — Dashboard aggregations — PENDING
Funnel, pending approvals, city summary queries. Numbers match DB reality.

## Stage 9 — CI + API docs — PENDING
GitHub Actions (lint + test + build), OpenAPI/Swagger at `/api/docs`.

## Swap-for-real (after Sujeet provides AWS account)

| Mock | Real | Swap point |
|------|------|-----------|
| Local SQLite | AWS-hosted SQL (Postgres or MySQL on RDS) | `knexfile.js` + `.env` connection string |
| `x-user-email` header | Google OAuth (Workspace: @carepalmoney.com, @impactguru.com) | `src/middleware/auth.ts` |
| `./uploads/` disk | **AWS S3 bucket** (in dedicated CarePal AWS account) | `src/services/storage.ts` |
| GitHub Pages frontend | Google Cloud Run (Jesse's preference) | Deployment workflow |

**Note:** Cross-cloud setup is deliberate — app runs on Google Cloud, storage + DB on AWS. Acceptable for this project; flag on the email to Sujeet so network/latency expectations are set.

---

## Blockers (narrowed)

- **Jesse to email Sujeet** — detailed data requirements (exact columns, resources needed). Blocks: AWS credentials delivery, BD list delivery.
- **Akhlaque's conversion rates** — only blocks Target vs Achievement funnel (separate feature, not part of this plan).
- **S3 folder structure** — not discussed on call; follow up via email before Stage 7 starts.
- **Retention policy** — CarePal hasn't confirmed; follow up via email.

## Meeting context — Apr 15 ATS discussion

Technical contact: **Sujeet Yadav (VP Engineering)**, not Ravi.
Participants: Jesse van de Zand, Akhlaque Khan, Sujeet Yadav.
Key outputs: separate AWS account, S3 for docs, requisition form is the source of hospital/city per requisition (no master lists needed).
